This program tests the efficieny of different types of sorting algorithms.

The different types of sorts that were used and tested are shaker sort, heap sort, randomized quick sort, external sort, rgb sort, comb sort, iterative merge sort, hybrid sort, bucket sort, and radix sort. 

After running these tests, the results were put into the TestResults.pdf file.

If you would like to edit the inputs, they can be accessed via the SortingDriver.java file in the Sorting_Algorithms/src/ folder.  

The methods and implementation for these sorting algorithms can be accessed via the SortingAlgorithms.java file in the Sorting_Algorithms/src/ folder.  

I would like readers to note, that although some of the sorting times are faster than others, there are also some comprimises that are made due to use of more space on some of the sorting algorithms.
